Now I'm a first year Ph.D. student at the Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR), Tsinghua University, co-advised by [Prof. Jingjing Liu](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1046/1194.htm) and Prof. [Hao Zhou](https://zhouh.github.io/). 

Previously, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence, from the School of Computer Science and Technology at Beijing Institute of Technology.

I’m particularly interested in developing probabilistic methods to advance machine learning research. Specifically, I’m well-versed in generative modeling—such as diffusion models, flow matching, and Bayesian flow networks—and their applications in molecular generation, including small molecules, crystals, and proteins.
